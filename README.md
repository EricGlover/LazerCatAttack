# LazerCatAttack

A Flash Game inspired by Galaga. This was the first program I ever wrote so if you're stumbling upon this repo looking for something usable you've come to the wrong place. I plan on using it as an example of how not program.

### Description

The game has 3 levels. Here's some of the notable features of the game.
1.  Randomized enemy spawn for replayability.
2.  3 Unique Boss Fights
3.  5 Unique Alien Enemies
4.  3 Main playstyles: On level two you unlock one of three systems : Shields, Blink-Jump, or a Void-Prism. All the enemies and the bosses are designed to depend on your use of one of these systems to be defeated. Each of the systems enables a unique playstyle.
5.  Randomized Ship Upgrades
6.  AI Flocking Behavior: One enemy is a squadron commander that nearby weaker ships into a squadron, when the enough of the weaker drone ships have gathered the squad jointly attacks the player ship.
7.  An array of different weapons for the player.
    1.  Normal Phaser Weapon
    2.  The Aft Cannon (it automatically fires when ships are behind you)
    3.  A Giant Lazer Beam : You unlock it by rescuing a cat on lvl 2
    4.  One of the three following systems : Shields, Blink-Jump, or a Void-Prism
    
##### Note
The only version I could find of it is one I made after the finished version so it has a few experimental features that I was noodling around with.



### Deployment

### Postmortem

I'll be writing a postmortem over the game and posting it on my website at some point. Keep an eye out for it at www.ericglover.me/blog.

##### Experimental Features to Avoid

 1.  Pressing shift and holding it activates a half implemented version of a weapon that allows you to split your ship in half to avoid enemies.
 2.  I believe there's also a 'HAMBURGULAR MODE' which I don't remember how to activate. It was included as a joke for a play-tester and not intended to be playable by users.
 3.   Last but not least, there may be some kind of boomerang weapon floating around in the code that I was tinkering with but I can't recall if it was ever enabled in the game.
